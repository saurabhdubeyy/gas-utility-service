## ðŸ‘¥ Support Staff Setup

There are multiple ways to create support staff accounts:

1. **Using the Admin Interface**:
   - Log in as a superuser
   - Create a new user
   - Add them to the "Support" group
   - Create a SupportRepresentative object linked to this user

2. **Using the Direct URL**:
   - Visit `/support/create-default-user/` to create a default support user
   - This creates a user with credentials:
     - Username: `support_admin`
     - Password: `support_password123`

3. **Programmatically**:
   - Use the Django management command:
     ```
     python manage.py create_support_user
     ```

Complete details on support system functionality are available in [SUPPORT_SETUP.md](SUPPORT_SETUP.md).
